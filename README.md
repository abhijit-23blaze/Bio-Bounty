## Introduction

Welcome to the Biodiversity Exploration App! This Flutter-based app gamifies the exploration of nature by encouraging users to photograph plants and animals. The app identifies the species and provides additional information about each one. Users earn bio points for each identification, and for every 10 bio points, we plant a tree to promote biodiversity and conservation. 🌳

## Introduction

Welcome to the Biodiversity Exploration App! This Flutter-based app gamifies the exploration of nature by encouraging users to photograph plants and animals. The app identifies the species and provides additional information about each one. Users earn bio points for each identification, and for every 10 bio points, we plant a tree to promote biodiversity and conservation. 🌳

## Features

- 🐾 **Species Identification**: Snap photos of plants and animals, and our AI will identify the species and provide detailed information.
- 🌱 **Earn Bio Points**: Collect bio points for each identified species. For every 10 bio points, a tree is planted.
- 📚 **Educational Content**: Learn about different species and their roles in the ecosystem.
- 🎮 **Gamification**: Engage with leaderboards, challenges, and seasonal events to keep the experience exciting.
- 🌐 **Community Building**: Share your findings, compete with others, and collaborate on conservation projects.
